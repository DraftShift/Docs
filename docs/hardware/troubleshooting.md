## Common Issues
### Shuttle and Backplate Resistance
- Measure the outside of your top pins. You should have 39mm.
- See [Print Tuning](../getting_started.md#print-tuning)

- If you have calibrated your print and still experience issues, try the heat treatment method or may need to clean out the bushings:

!!! tip "Heat Treating"
    If you printed the shuttle and backplate and things are just not smooth or you have slight binding, you can Heat Treat it and here is how.

    - Fully assemble the shuttle and backplate with Bushing, Pins, Screws and Magnets
    - Set your heat bed to 100-110°C
    - Once at temperature, mate both parts fully, and set them on the bed with the backplate (tool side) down
    - After 20+ minutes pick them up and slide them 3-4 times, then fully mate them once again
    - With both parts still fully mated, set them down with the backplate (tool side) down someplace flat and at room temperature and let them fully cool without touching the for 5+ hours
    - Try and slide them again and you should feel an improvement, you can try this multiple times if you are still not satisfied

    Big thank you to unguided-wanderer on Discord for this technique.

!!! tip "Cleaning Bushings"
    Sometimes the bushings aren't debured or do not slide well when you recieve them.

    - Find a drill bit 4mm or smaller (I’m using 3mm in the video at the link)
    - Using your thumb, apply pressure onto the bush and roll back and forth on the drill bit.
    - Test on the pin again
    - Rinse and repeat.
    - Some bushings take multiple tries, but try not to over do it, just enough that the bushing falls on the pin.
