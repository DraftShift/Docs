## Dock Terminology
* `stubby` - Refers to the depth of the dock (Y axis) being less than `standard` and is only for machines not running Door Buffer. `stubby` is not available for all toolheads.

* `short` - Refers to the height of the dock (Z axis) being less than `standard`. For Voron printers, the shorter height is not available for larger toolheads. For Micron printers the `short` variant is a requirement.

* `wide` - Refers to the width of the dock (X axis) being more than `standard`. This is not something that is optional. Depending on the toolhead, the dock will be wider if required.

* `standard` - The configuration that will work on any Voron printer, but may incur unnecessary losses in printable area.

* `frame` - The upright portion of the dock that connects to the printers frame and optionally a crossbar.

* `base` - The section that the tools rests on while docked.

* `backplate` - Attaches to the rear of the base to allow adjustment of the tools resting position.

* `blocker` - A section that mounts inside the `base` that blocks the nozzle while docked which helps with ooze control.

* `wiper` - A means of wiping the nozzle as the toolhead is exiting the dock.
